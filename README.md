**Salem State University Computer Science Club's _new and improved_ website**


Salem States Programming Club's old (well, current) [website](http://cs.salemstate.edu/~byi/progClub/progClub_www/SSU_contests/) is a tad bit... outdated. For that reason —and for the fact that it looks bad on everyone part of the CS department (students and faculty alike)— we have decided that it is time for a facelift, or in this case, a completely new face.
