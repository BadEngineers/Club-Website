Salem State University Computer Science Club's new and improved website


Salem States's old "Programming Club" [website](http://cs.salemstate.edu/~byi/progClub/progClub_www/SSU_contests/) is so awful, that it is a sacrilege to humanity. For that reason —and for the fact that it looks bad on everyone part of the CS department (students and faculty alike)— we have decided that it is time for a facelift (to put it lightly).
